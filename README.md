# RemoveUnneccesaryButtons
A Vencord theme that removes buttons I deem unneccesary.

Meant to be used with [NewerOldCord by FrCynda](https://github.com/FrCynda/NewerOldCord). Can't guarantee all the button locations will be correct if used by itself, but from my five minutes of testing it seems fine.
